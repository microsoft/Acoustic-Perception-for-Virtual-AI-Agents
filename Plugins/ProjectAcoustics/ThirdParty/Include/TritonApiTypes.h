//! An object that holds the parameters returned from QueryAcoustics calls, summarizing
//! the acoustics between dynamic source and listener location.
//! All directional information is located in Triton's canonical coordinate system.
//! The following image shows Triton's coordinate system, as well as the directions for
//! the ReflLoudnessDB Channels in the TritonAcousticParameters struct.
//! Note that since Triton computes propagation in world coordinates,
//! all its directions are locked to the world, not the listener's head.
//! This means that the user's head rotation must be applied on top of these parameters
//! to reproduce the acoustics. This is the job of the spatializer, assumed to be a separate component.
